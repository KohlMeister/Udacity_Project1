# Udacity: Project 1

Movie Trailer Website Project

## Getting Started

The files within this repo will generate a webpage that displays movie titles, posters and trailers. 
To get started, download the provided files within the repo. 

### Files

* *media.py*
* *entertainment_center.py*
* *fresh_tomatoes.py*

### Creating the Webpage

Running entertainment_center.py will generate the webpage and .html file. Once entertainment_center.py has been run, click on a
poster to see the trailer played.

```
Be aware - If the .html file defaults to open in another program than an internet browser, the .html file that gets created by entertainment_center.py
can be opened directly with a specified internet browser.
```
